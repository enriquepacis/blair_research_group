Learn Computer Programming -*- mode: org -*-

* Welcome!

Welcome to my website dedicated to all people everywhere who are interested
in learning computer programming. This is a passion of mine, and I want to
learn with you and from you, and share with you ways you can:

1. Learn computer programming.
2. Monetize computer programming as a hobby, side job, or even a career.
3. Use computer programming to free yourself to do other things.

Of course, the above concepts are not independent: your interest in them may have these concepts overlap considerably.

* Motivation

Why learn computer programming? Because you are interested in ...

1. Additional income. The finacial incentive here is huge. Computer programming is one of the highest-paying industries today. See some [[https://money.usnews.com/careers/best-jobs/computer-programmer/salary][2017 data]] on computer programmer compensation in the U.S. Also, here is some [[https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/computer-programmers.htm][data]] from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
2. A flexible job. Computer programmers can work from any place where they have access to a computer network, and they can generally set their own hours.
3. Saving time and effort. Often, mind-numbing and repetitive tasks on a computer can be automated. This saves time and energy, and eliminates human fatigue along with associated human errors. When tasks are automated, humans are liberated to perform other tasks that are not so easily automated. Productivity is increased, and the cost of labor for automated tasks is saved. Tasks that could be automated can be as simple as renaming several photos in a consistent way or finding and deleting duplicate photos in your photo library. Personally, I've saved thousands of person-hours of labor by automating the collection, analysis, and visualizing scientific data, and I've taught others to do the same. Another interesting application of computer automation is algorithmic trading. Here, computer-savvy investors write programs to monitor market conditions. Certain conditions trigger buy or sell events for certain stocks. Having systematized trading in this manner, the trader is now unbudened from closely monitoring the market, and finds the freedom to do other things.
4. A beautiful and fun life-long mental exercise and discipline. I think of computer programming as an art and science of solving problems logically, and in a robust manner. I find few tasks as satisfying as writing smart, reusable code which accomplishes a task effectively and robustly. This is a fun exercise that can change the way you approach problems in all areas of life, as computer programming is an exercise in applied logic and problem-solving.
Let us now further motivate your interests in computer programming,
as well as uncover some of your personal interests and goals here so
that you may better guide your learning and exploration into the world of
computer programming. To do this, I have compiled for you some videos
that you can watch to help you think about how you might make use of
computer programming.

As you watch, ask your self some questions:
1. How would you like to use computer programming? The answer to this can help you figure out what languages you should learn. One common answer is to learn web develpment. In that case, a new web developer should learn HTML, [[https://www.javascript.com][JavaScript]], and CSS. People who are interested in automating tasks could consider the wildly-popular [[https://www.python.org][Python]]. Scientific programmers might want to learn [[https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html][Matlab]] or its open-source clone, [[https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/][Octave]]. Video designers or animators may be interested in Python and [[https://www.blender.org][Blender]]. Game designers might want to learn C#. iOS developers should learn Swift, and mobile apps may be written in numerous other languages, like Python or JavaScript.
2. What opportunities can you find or create to help you earn income from computer programming? It is helpful to have a goal in mind to help focus and direct your learning efforts. 

* Tips
Some brief tips here. You'll also encounter in the videos, but I think they are worth highlighting.
- Practice is vital. Like learning spoken languages, learning computer programming requires lots of practice. I recommend starting with one language at first. Get proficient, and you'll find that many of the concepts you learned for your first language are transferrable and will help you learn other languages.
- Find a community of other people who also aspire to learn computer programming. People in community can encourage one another to push forward through difficulty and motivate one another to learn more. Also, they can share insights. Facing challenges often is best done with a community, and learning programming is no exception. The support and insight of others will likely be a key factor in learning computer programming.
- One of the best ways to learn is to teach. As a teacher, I've found that I develop the strongest grasp and the best insights into a subject or a skill when I teach others. This is another reason community is important: it provides opportunities to teach and share what you learned.
- Find mentors. Better than teaching alone is teaching/mentoring others, and being mentored yourself. This holds true for all areas of life, I believe. When I was studying martial arts, I found that my progress was at its fastest when I studied under a teacher, and I myself was a teacher to others. Within a community of like-minded learners, you can find mentors for yourself, also. Mentors can tell you about that weak area you didn't even know you had, or they can give you an insider tip that makes simple a challenge you thought was insurmountable.
- Fall in love with [[https://stackoverflow.com][stackoverflow.com]]. I don't really need to tell you this one, as you'll likely find stackoverflow.com yourself and fall in with it yourself. When you get stuck, or if you have an error, or if you want to know how skilled programmers perform a task in a particular language, do a Google search for "how to do X in Y", where "X" is the the task you want to accomplish, and "Y" is name of your programming language. The top hits will likely include stackoverflow.com discussions on your task or error. In these threads, it is very likely that you will find minimal examples that show you how to deal with the issue you face. "I am one with stackoverflow; stackoverflow is with me."
