# Higher Education

## Is it worth it?
Yes and no. It depends on how much the student (or his/her family) pays, and the reward the student benefits from this.

In general, being more educated correlates to earning more income. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) has a nice page on [the value of education](https://www.bls.gov/careeroutlook/2018/data-on-display/education-pays.htm). The trend is that the more education you have, the more money you'll bring home each month or each year.
