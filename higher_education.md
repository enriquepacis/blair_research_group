# Higher Education

Do you have children? Would you like to prepare them for adulthood? Higher education can be an important part of your child's future life.

## My perspective
I'm a first-generation college student - one whose parent's didn't attend any U.S. colleges or universities. While I lacked family role models and guidance to help me choose a career and navigate my way through the world of higher education, I was fortunate and blessed to find mentors and role models who showed me enough guidance to make it through. I survived education at a top-20 U.S. private university, and I eventually got a Ph.D. Also, I've taught and researched at very unique institutions (University of Notre Dame, U.S. Naval Academy, Baylor University), and I've grown alongside and taught thousands of very well-prepared students. I've had the chance to see many things and trends that work well for young people, and other things that don't work so well.

## Is it worth it?
Yes and no. It depends on how much the student (or his/her family) pays, and the reward the student benefits from this.

*In general, being more educated correlates to earning more income.* The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) has a nice page on [the value of education](https://www.bls.gov/careeroutlook/2018/data-on-display/education-pays.htm). The trend is that the more education you have, the more money you'll bring home each month or each year. Given that it's expensive to raise a child in the U.S., I recommend earning as much as possible. This means it's worth it to prepare your children as much as possible for higher education.

"How much does a child cost?" you ask. Good question! The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates [the cost of raising a child](https://www.usda.gov/media/blog/2017/01/13/cost-raising-child) for you.

Remeber, not all jobs and not all industries are created equal. Some pay more than others. With escalating education costs, it can be easy to pay lots of money and incur too much debt for an edcuation, only to be marketable in a low-paying industry. A winning strategy is to pay as little as possible for education, but maximize your opportunities for income. The Visual Capitalist has a page which shows [which college majors earn the most money](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/visualizing-salaries-college-degrees/).

For individuals who are not as academically inclined, learning a skilled trade could be a helpful way to develop a marketable skill [indeed.com [data on skilled trades](https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Skilled-Trades/salaries)].


# Preparing Children for Adulthood

## Role Models
When preparing children for college, it is helpful to allow them to interact with adults of numerous professional backgrounds. It has been my experience that young people who do not know or interact with professionals in certain industries don't think about careers in those industries. For example, children who don't know engineers typically don't become engineers.

On the other hand, I've met countless students studying field X because they had parents, extended family, or family friends who were professionals in field X. Here, "X" could be engineering, military, medicine, finance, entrepeneurship, business, or whatever. Adult professional role models enable children to imagine being of the same profession and encourage them to believe that they can and should study and prepare for a career of this type. While some students study in fields unrelated to the professions of family and friends, these students have been rare in my experience.

*Put me to the test.* Think about why you are in your profession. How did you get into that field? What influence did adult role models have in your life? Think about your family and friends. Have you seen children follow in the footsteps of their parents and adult friends?

## Education
Take pride, ownership, and play an active role educating your children. Consider educating your children as *your responsibility*, not the responsibility of your state or your nation.  This can take many forms, from being a well-informed parent to being their educators themselves.

1. Read to your children. One of the strongest indicators of academic success is exposure to the written word. Much research has been done on this, including [this work](https://www.washington.edu/news/2017/08/28/how-reading-and-writing-with-your-child-boost-more-than-just-literacy/) from the University of Washington.
2. Share in hobbies, activities, and sports with your children. These not only provide bonding opportunities, but they also teach children the children about dealing with failure, learning from mistakes, overcoming obstacles, persistance, the value of practice and skill building, socialization, respect, competition, and so much more.

# Challenges College Students Face

## First-generation College Students
First-generation college students (FGCS) are students whose parents did not go to college. It is widely-recognized that for these students to graduate successfully, they have more challenges to overcome than their non-FGCS peers.  First, the have no trusted adults or close role models who can tell them what to expect. A break-up with a sweetheart could motivate a FGCS student to quit college, whereas a non-FGCS student might have heard from parent(s) that these things are part of the experience. FGCS may not know how to navigate the world of university-level education as well as their non-FGCS peers, who have parents able to guide them through every challenge and decision they face. I am a FGCS who went on to eventually earn a Ph.D. in engineering, and I can attest to knowing very little and having very little family guidance as I went through college.

There is a growing understanding of the needs of FGCS at universities across America, and many universities are building support structures for FGCS. I recommend that FGCS deliberately seek these resources out, as well as seek out older, successful, and trusted students who can mentor them along the way. On my own journey, I was mentored by my Navy ROTC upperclassmen and staff, who had a vested interest in seeing me graduate from college.

## Mental Health
I recently heard from our university's counselling center that students seeking treatment at campus mental health facilities is on the rise (here's an [article about it](https://www.apa.org/advocacy/higher-education/mental-health/) from the American Psychological Association). Our counselling center identified as common stressors for young people:
1. An inability to cope with failure. Contributing factors here could be grade inflation in earlier years of education, parents who immediately side with children whenever faced with disciplinary action by educators, the use of participation trophies, and numerous other causes. This is so common that now, universities are intentionally [training their students on failure](https://www.wsj.com/articles/failure-101-colleges-teach-students-how-to-cope-with-setbacks-11545129000).
2. Mounting pressures that young adults face from social media as some of the most common stressors they deal with. Books like [iGen ...](http://www.jeantwenge.com/igen-book-by-dr-jean-twenge/) highlight the challenges faced by our young adults from being ultra-connected. These challelnges are quite unlike challenges faced by previous generations.
