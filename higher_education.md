# Higher Education

## Is it worth it?
Yes and no. It depends on how much the student (or his/her family) pays, and the reward the student benefits from this.

*In general, being more educated correlates to earning more income.* The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) has a nice page on [the value of education](https://www.bls.gov/careeroutlook/2018/data-on-display/education-pays.htm). The trend is that the more education you have, the more money you'll bring home each month or each year. Given that it's expensive to raise a child in the U.S., I recommend earning as much as you can.

"How much does a child cost?" you ask. Good question! The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates [the cost of raising a child](https://www.usda.gov/media/blog/2017/01/13/cost-raising-child) for you.

Remeber, not all jobs and not all industries are created equal. Some pay more than others. With escalating education costs, it can be easy to pay lots of money and incur too much debt for an edcuation, only to be marketable in a low-paying industry. A winning strategy is to pay as little as possible for education, but maximize your opportunities for income. The Visual Capitalist has a page which shows [which college majors earn the most money](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/visualizing-salaries-college-degrees/).

For individuals who are not as academically inclined, learning a skilled trade could be a helpful way to develop a marketable skill [indeed.com [data on skilled trades](https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Skilled-Trades/salaries)].


# Preparing Children for Adulthood

## Role Models
When preparing children for college, it is helpful to allow them to interact with adults of numerous professional backgrounds. It has been my experience that young people who do not know or interact with professionals in certain industries don't think about careers in those industries. For example, children who don't know engineers typically don't become engineers.

On the other hand, I've met countless students studying field X because they had parents, extended family, or family friends who were professionals in field X. Here, "X" could be engineering, military, medicine, finance, entrepeneurship, business, These adult professional role models enabled these children to imagine being of the same profession and encourage them to believe that they could and should study and prepare for a career of this type. While some students study in fields unrelated to the professions of family and friends, these students have been rare in my experience.

# Challenges College Students Face

## Mental Health
I recently heard from our university's counselling center that students seeking treatment at campus mental health facilities is on the rise (here's an [article about it](https://www.apa.org/advocacy/higher-education/mental-health/) from the American Psychological Association). Our counselling center identified as common stressors for young people:
1. An inability to cope with failure. Contributing factors here could be grade inflation in earlier years of education, parents who immediately side with children whenever faced with disciplinary action by educators, the use of participation trophies, and numerous other causes. This is so common that now, universities are intentionally [training their students on failure](https://www.wsj.com/articles/failure-101-colleges-teach-students-how-to-cope-with-setbacks-11545129000).
2. Mounting pressures that young adults face from social media as some of the most common stressors they deal with. Books like [iGen ...](http://www.jeantwenge.com/igen-book-by-dr-jean-twenge/) highlight the challenges faced by our young adults from being ultra-connected. These challelnges are quite unlike challenges faced by previous generations.
