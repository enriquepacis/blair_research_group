Learn Computer Programming -*- mode: org -*-

* Welcome!

Welcome to my website dedicated to all people everywhere who are interested
in learning computer programming. This is a passion of mine, and I want to
learn with you and from you, and share with you ways you can:

1. Learn computer programming
2. Monetize computer programming as a hobby, side job, or even a career.

* Motivation

Why learn computer programming? Because you are interested in ...

1. Additional income. Computer programming is one of the highest-paying industries today.
2. A flexible job. Computer programmers can work from any place where they have access to a computer network, and they can generally set their own hours.
3. Saving time and effort. Often, mind-numbing and repetitive tasks on a computer can be automated. This saves time and energy, and eliminates human fatigue along with associated human errors that may be made. When tasks are automated, humans are liberated to perform other tasks that are not so easily automated; productivity is increased, and the cost of labor for automated tasks is saved.
4. A beautiful and fun life-long mental exercise and discipline. I think of computer programming as an art and science of solving problems logically, and in a robust manner. I find few tasks as satisfying as writing smart, reusable code which accomplishes a task effectively and robustly. This is a fun exercise that can change the way you approach problems in all areas of life, as computer programming is an exercise in applied logic and problem-solving.
Let us now further motivate your interests in computer programming,
as well as uncover some of your personal interests and goals here so
that you may better guide your learning and exploration into the world of
computer programming. To do this, I have compiled for you some videos
that you can watch to help you think about how you might make use of
computer programming.

As you watch, ask your self some questions:
1. How would you like to use computer programming? The answer to this can help you figure out what languages you should learn. One common answer is to learn web develpment. In that case, a new web developer should learn HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. People who are interested in automating tasks could consider the wildly-popular Python 3. Scientific programmers might want to learn Matlab or its open-source clone, octave. Video designers or animators may be interested in Python and Blender. Game designers might want to learn C#. iOS developers should learn Swift.
2. What opportunities can you find or create to help you earn income from computer programming? It is helpful to have a goal in mind to help focus and direct your learning efforts.
