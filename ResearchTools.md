### Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE)

Why ASE? ASE is a Python front end for chemical calculation platforms such as VASP, Quantum ESPRESSO, NWChem, GAMESS, and many others that can make life much easier.
1. Simplicity. Many DFT platforms require complex text input files, and they output user-unfriendly text output files. ASE can manage the input and output files, and it has many well-developed algorithms for importing or creating complex atomic structures.
2. Power. DFT calculations can be supercharged by ASE's Python interface, which allows iteration and visualization. Additionally, ASE can add checkpointing to calculations.
